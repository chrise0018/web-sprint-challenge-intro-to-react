# Sprint Challenge Instructions Template

> Text like this that uses the `>` character (quoted block in Markdown) is commentary and instructions for you (the curriculum developer) to replace. They should not be left in your final result. Conversely, text not in a quote block is either a example for you to modify, or text that will usually be left as-is for most if not all sprint challenges.

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past sprint and apply them in a concrete project. This sprint explored **`<Sprint Subject Here>`**. During this sprint, you studied **`<High-level sprint topics here>`**. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate your mastery of these skills by creating **`<describe project here>`**.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the sprint challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your TL if you need direction. 

_You have **three hours** to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly._


## Introduction

> In this section, introduce the challenge,  with a high level explanation of the components of the project.
> 
> This section should include examples in the form of screenshots, screen recording GIFs, and/or links to an example.

In meeting the minimum viable product (MVP) specifications listed below, your project should look like the solution examples below:

### Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons) and your team lead as the evaluate your solution.

## Interview Questions

> List out the topics covered that students should study and review to be prepared for the questions asked in the TL interview. You can use the list of learning objectives that should be covered by the interview as a start.

Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. You might prepare by writing down your own answers before hand.

1. Describe semantic HTML 

2. Understand when and how to use CSS reset

3. Understand the use of the command line interface (CLI)

4. Explain git commands and why git is valuable to a team of developers.

5. Define mobile-first design in your own words, and the difference in layout types.

You are expected to be able to answer questions in these areas. Your responses contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade. 

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Set Up

> This section should include instruction for the sprint challenge. These should only cover things that are _not_ being evaluated by the challenge itself, e.g. environment/project setup, link to a starter project, etc. In general, this will be the following Git fork, clone, branch, commit, push, create pull request flow, though may need to be adapted for some specific challenges.

- [ ] Create a forked copy of this project
- [ ] Add your team lead as collaborator on Github
- [ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Lambda's by mistake!)
- [ ] Create a new branch: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`.
- [ ] Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly
- [ ] Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName>`

### Task 2: Project Requirements

> This section should include requirements for the sprint challenge itself. The idea is to be explicit with the student about the things their project solution needs to implement, without telling them **how** to do any of these things. Be sure all learning objectives in your sprint challenge list are covered. 

Your finished project must include all of the following requirements:

> (The following is an example):

#### Home Page

[Review the provided design file for the home page](design/home.png).  Notice the navigation and header images are missing.

* [ ] Uses Semantic HTML and CSS to create the missing navigation and header
* [ ] The `About` navigation item must be linked to the [about.html](about.html) page
* [ ] Your design must be responsive such that it is accessible on mobile(500px) and tablet(800 px) and matches the [mobile](design/mobile.png) wireframe. This functionality must be implemented using flexbox.
* [ ] Uses all box model properties so that margins, borders, and padding match the wireframes
* [ ] You must add responsive breakpoints to your code by using media queries
* [ ] All 10 boxes on the home page are correctly styled with background colors using the guide below:


* [ ] box1: `teal`
* [ ] box2: `gold`
* [ ] box3: `cadetblue`
* [ ] box4: `coral`
* [ ] box5: `crimson`
* [ ] box6: `forestgreen`
* [ ] box7: `darkorchid`
* [ ] box8: `hotpink`
* [ ] box9: `indigo`
* [ ] box10: `dodgerblue`

In your solution, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results. You will be scored on your adherence to proper code style and good organization. Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your work and perform basic professional polishing including spell-checking and grammar-checking on your work. It is better to submit a challenge that meets MVP than one that attempts too much and does not.

### Task 3: Stretch Goals 

> Include stretch goals in this section. These are additional things the student can do go beyond basic proficiency, and push their scores on the challenge up to a 3. Be clear that these are *not* required. Completing all of the tasks in the required section must be sufficient to  demonstrate proficiency of all sprint objectives, and earn a score of '2. 

> Example stretch goals below:

After finishing your required elements, you can push your work further. These goals may or may not be things you have learned in this module but they build on the material you just studied. Time allowing, stretch your limits and see if you can deliver on the following optional goals:

* [ ] Build a page of your choosing from the navigation items.  Come up with content and images that fit the theme.  
* [ ] Introduce CSS animations to your site.
* [ ] Build a contact page and create a form with several inputs of your choosing

## Submission format

Follow these steps for completing your project.

- [ ] Submit a Pull-Request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into master (student's  Repo). **Please don't merge your own pull request**
- [ ] Add your team lead as a reviewer on the pull-request
- [ ] Your team lead will count the project as complete after receiving your pull-request
